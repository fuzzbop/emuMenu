emuMenu is a simple emulator launcher

requirements are python3, python3-sqlite3, python3-qt5


I wanted a simple launcher without all the fluff for those of us with huge collections. I tried to write
this with large collections in mind, but it is also the first thing I have written in a large number of 
years. There may be bad practice and things in place and it is very much so a work in progress.

### TODO:
* make this read-me better
* make sql calls better
* ~~take out manual work around that i have in place for hbmame since it is a merged set~~
* ~~handle merged mame rom sets,~~ and custom rom lists for mame
* more stuff as I think about it

### Wayout TO-DO:
* simple fullscreen gui possible
